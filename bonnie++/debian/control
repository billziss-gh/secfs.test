Description: Hard drive bottleneck testing benchmark suite.
 It is called Bonnie++ because it was based on the Bonnie program.  This
 program also tests performance with creating large numbers of files.
 Now includes zcav raw-read test program.  A modern hard drive will have more
 sectors in the outer tracks because they are longer.  The hard drive will
 have a number (often more than 8) of zones where each zone has the same
 number of sectors (due to the need for an integral number of sectors per
 track).  This program allows you to determine the levels of performance
 provided by different zones and store them in a convenient format for gnuplot.
